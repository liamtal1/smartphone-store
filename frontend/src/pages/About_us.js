                <h2>Welcome to SmartPhone, your number one source for original smartphones. We're
                    dedicated to giving you the very best of phones, with a focus on dependability,
                    customer service and convenient access. Founded in 2019 by Liam Tal & Katya Fichman,
                    SmartPhone has come a long way from its beginnings in a home office.  We started selling
                    phones in shops, but our combined ambition, drive and abilities soon made us look for new
                    challenges and new markets. Starting an online shop allowed us to develop a strong international
                    presence. We now serve customers all over the world, and are thrilled to be a part of the fair
                    trade wing of the phones industry. We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering
                    them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
